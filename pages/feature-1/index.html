                <h2>SAMBA OG</h2>
                <p>Originally designed in the 1940s to cope with icy football pitches, the Samba is a low profile trainer that would turn out to be a triple threat – the right shoe at the right time at the right price.</p>
            </div>

                <img src="./assets/img/samba-cl.png" alt="Image 2">
                <h2>SAMBA CLASSIC</h2>
                <p>While the Samba Classic resembles the OG, it features a slew of extra details that make it unique. The Classic was created in 1950 for indoor soccer use, and it has dominated the indoor game for decades since, with recent GR releases a faithful remake of the original design.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container" id="container3">
                <img src="./assets/img/samba-vegan.png" alt="Image 3">
                <h2>SAMBA VEGAN</h2>
                <p>The name says it all, really. In response to a growing vegan population and a push for more environmentally conscious products, adidas released the Samba Vegan, which is exactly the same as the Samba OG but of course made entirely with synthetic faux leather and a vegan alternative to suede. </p>

                <div class="content-2">
                    <h2>VELOSAMBA</h2>
                    <p>The adidas Velosamba is one of the zaniest iterations on this list, and it's for the cyclists. Up top, it looks like a regular Samba, but underneath the midsole is a recess that fits two-bolt pedal cleats, like the Shimano SPD or the Time ATAC. Additionally, they come with built-in lace bungees that ensure loose lace ends won't get stuck in the chainring teeth or pedal axe.</p>

                <div class="content-2">
                    <h2>SAMBA SUPER</h2>
                    <p>The Samba Super was adidas’ answer to the original silhouette morphing from a reliable soccer sneaker to a lifestyle behemoth. This pair is made for the streets instead of the pitch, opting for a chunkier build, a slimmer foam sole at the rear, and an extended outsole at the forefoot. </p>

                <div class="content-2">
                    <h2>SAMBA ROSE</h2>
                    <p>There are quite a few differences between a woman and man’s foot, not just in the overall size, but in the structure as well, which is why adidas introduced the Samba Rose in 2018 – a Samba built specifically for women to provide more comfort when compared to the unisex Samba OG.</p>

                <div class="content-3">
                    <h2>SAMBA RM</h2>
                    <p>Samba RM aimed to ‘modernise the heritage look’, and it did this by taking the classic silhouette and adding additional comfort and a sleeker, more round look. The Three Stripes gave a BOOST to the soles, providing a more responsive midsole that is slightly higher than the standard.</p>

                    <h2>SAMBA ADV</h2>
                    <p>This ADV edition is an exact copy of the OG Samba, but reinforced for skaters. Back in the 90s, street skaters adopted the low-to-the-ground Samba for its clean profile and functionality, but the Three Stripes wanted to take it one step further by upgrading the T-Toe suede with two layers of Adituff toe reinforcement. </p>
